# RocketLeague-RL

Code for training RL agents in a simplified version of Rocket League in [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine.
We use [ML agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to setup the environment and 
[stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) to train our models.
